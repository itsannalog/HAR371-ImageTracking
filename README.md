# HAR371-ImageTracking
 Week 4: Image Tracking Assignment


# What is this? 
  Created for HAR 371 (Creative Programming II), this Processing sketch uses edge detection and "blobs" to create a glitchy, abstract portrait of whatever is in view of the webcam. The image becomes more or less glitchy depending on the lighting and webcam quality. All images below were taken in a dark room, with variable light coming from both my laptop screen and a dimmable softbox light.
